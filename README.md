Goal : The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which the people did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. We could use any of the other variables to predict with. We should create a report describing how we built our model, how we used cross validation, what we think the expected out of sample error is, and why we made the choices you did. We will also use the prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
